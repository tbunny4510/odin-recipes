        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken, which can also<br>
            be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of<br>
            chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, bonless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2<br>
                inch thickness</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper.<br>
                Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into seperate<br>
                shallow dishes. Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking<br>
                off any excess; dip into egg, and then press into panko<br>
                crumbs until well coated on both sides.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place<br>
                chicken in the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4<br>
                minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate<br>
                to drain.</li>
        </ol>
